            <h2>The Kellybab</h2>
                <p>The Kellybab is a recipe that was published by a lady called Kelly Bramill. It’s become a bit of a go to by the UK BBQ community.</p>

                <p>This is a stunning recipe and it’s not spicy so it’s perfect for kids. You can add chilli sauce of course and I do.</p>
            
                <p>Serve this in home made pittas with shredded white cabbage, onion, lettuce, tomato and some tzatziki.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1.8kg boneless chicken thighs</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp tomato puree</li>
                    <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                    <li>Zest and juice of two lemons</li>
                    <li>2 tsp onion granules</li>
                    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp ground allspice</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>3tsp salt</li>
                    <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
                    <li>8 tbsp olive oil</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Method</h2>
                <h3>To marinate the chicken</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place the chicken in a large bowl and, in a separate bowl, mix the rest of the ingredients together really well. <br> Don’t worry about the amount of oil. Its purely there for marinating purposes and won’t all end up in the finished dish.</li>
                        <li>Pour the marinade over the chicken thighs and mix everything together thoroughly. You want every bit of chicken smothered in the paste.</li>
                        <li>Leave to marinade for at least a couple of hours, overnight is best.</li>
                    </ol>
