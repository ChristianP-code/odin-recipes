            <h2>The Kellybab</h2>
                <p>The Kellybab is a recipe that was published by a lady called Kelly Bramill. It’s become a bit of a go to by the UK BBQ community.</p>

                <p>This is a stunning recipe and it’s not spicy so it’s perfect for kids. You can add chilli sauce of course and I do.</p>
            
                <p>Serve this in home made pittas with shredded white cabbage, onion, lettuce, tomato and some tzatziki.</p>
